        <p>           
            The Rainbow Bird is an aboriginal folktale that originated in Northern Australia.<br> 
            It tells of the origins of fire and its association with the rainbow bird. The tale<br> 
            is aimed at children and teaches the importance of sharing. While it has been told <br>
            orally across many different cultures, it was published and popularized in 1993 in <br>
            a book by Eric Maddern. Today, it is one of the most popular folktales in Australia.

            The story is about a time when Australia was dark and freezing. A bird, forced to <br>
            eat her food raw and cold, asked a crocodile for firesticks. The crocodile refused <br>
            to share and hoarded all of the sticks for himself. The bird flew down and stole <br>
            the firesticks, giving them to all those who needed them. As she did so, the fire <br>
            created beautiful, vibrant colors on her tail, making her into a rainbow bird. <br>
            Afraid of fire, the crocodile has been living in watery swamps ever since.
