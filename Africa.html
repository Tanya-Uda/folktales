        <h2><a href="hare.html">The Hare and The Lion</a></h2>
        <p>           
            The story of the Hare and the Lion has no known exact origins and no known author,<br> 
            though it has been traced back to East Africa. There are also similar versions of <br>
            the story in Sanskrit dating back to the fourth century. It’s a story that’s been <br>
            told orally through many different people. The children’s tale is about the importance<br> 
            of wit and intelligence over brute force. In later versions, it can be told as a story <br>
            of good over evil. In others, it is told to teach the destructive effects of pride <br>
            and arrogance.

            The story is about a lion who’s grown tired of hunting. He commands all of the animals<br>
            to take turns being his prey each day. When it is the hare’s turn, he spots a deep <br>
            well as he approaches the lion’s den. The lion is angry at the hare’s late arrival <br>
            and demands to know why. The hare then claims another lion tried to eat him. The lion <br>
            orders the hare to take him to the lion, and the hare shows him the well. The lion <br>
            looks in and mistakes his reflection for another lion and pounces into the well, <br>
            killing himself. The tale remains a popular legend across the world today.
