        <h2><a href="cat.html">Domingo's Cat</a></h2>
        <p>
            The legend of Domingo’s Cat originated in Brazil and was told orally.<br>
            Because of this, it is difficult to pinpoint when exactly the legend of <br>
            Domingo’s Cat began, though it has much in common with The Master Cat or<br>
            Puss in Boots from the 17th century. One of the earliest publications of <br>
            the story was in Elsie Spicer Eells’ Tales of Giants From Brazil, published in 1918.<br>
            It’s a short fable aimed at children to teach them the value of loyalty and kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fable is about Domingo, a poor man forced to sell his belongings for food.<br>
            His only possession left is his cat. Domingo promises not to sell the cat, <br>
            and the cat in turn promises to help him get money for food. The cat then proceeds<br> 
            to help Domingo get money, a wife who is the daughter of the king, and a beautiful<br> 
            palace of silver, gold, and diamonds. The cat then disappears to help others in need.<br> 
            <a href="cat.html">Domingo's Cat</a> remains a popular story in South America, and across the world, today.
