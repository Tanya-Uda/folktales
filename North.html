        <h2><a href="paul.html">Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox</a></h2>
        <p>
            The story of Paul Bunyan originated in the mid-1800s. <br>
            The lumberjack is said to have worked in the forests of <br>
            North America during the lumber industry’s heyday. <br>
            He is said to have been seven feet tall with a seven-foot stride, <br>
            though some legends depict him as tall as a few hundred meters. <br>
            He and his giant blue ox, Babe, are credited with everything <br>
            from creating Lake Superior to creating the Mississippi River. <br>
            Historians widely believed Paul Bunyan was based on the real-life<br>
            Canadian lumberjack Fabian Fournier, who worked in Michigan after <br>
            the Civil War.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tales of Paul Bunyan began orally in the 1800’s. <br>
            The first written reference to Paul Bunyan was in 1893 <br>
            in the Gladwin County Record, but the legend wasn’t <br>
            popularized until 1916 in a pamphlet by William B. Laughead.<br>
             Ever since, there have been multiple children’s adaptations <br>
             made about the giant lumberjack, including one by Walt Disney. <br>
             Travelers can also see giant statues of <a href="paul.html">Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox</a> <br>
             all across the United State
