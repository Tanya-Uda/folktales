        <h2><a href="hamelin.html">The Pied Piper of Hamelin</a></h2>
        <p>
            The Pied Piper of Hamelin originated in Hamelin, Germany in the Middle Ages<br> 
            during a giant rat infestation that caused the black plague. It tells of the<br> 
            supposed fate of the children that disappeared from Hamelin in 1284. <br>
            The story is one of the most accurately located fables in terms of its origin.<br> 
            It has since been retold by Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning.<br> 
            The moral of The Pied Piper story is to always keep your promises. This fable <br>
            tells of a man in pied clothing who tells the mayor he can lead the rats out<br>
            of Hamelin for a fee of 1000 guilders. The mayor agrees but refuses to pay the<br> 
            piper when the rats are gone. The piper then leads all of the children out of <br> 
            Hamelin, where they are never heard from again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many different variations of this story exist. Some say the piper led the children <br> 
            to a river where they drowned. Others claim the piper led the children to a dark<br> 
            cave where they were never seen again. Other stories state the children died from <br>
            the plague carried by the rats, making the piper the personification of death.<br> 
            More still say that the piper led not just children, but all of the people of <br>
            Hamelin out of the town. The final popular theory is that the piper made the <br>
            children into child soldiers. The story of the pied piper is still widely popular<br> 
            and adapted today.
