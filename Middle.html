        <h2><a href="thieves.html">Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</a></h2>
        <p>           
            Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves is an Arabic folktale published in the 18th century <br>
            in One Thousand and One Nights. It was added in French by the European translator <br>
            Antoine Galland and is the earliest known written version of the story. It remains <br>
            one of the most popular tales from the book. A children’s tale told around the world, <br>
            the story teaches against having too much greed and selfishness. The story is of <br>
            Ali Baba and his brother Cassim, the son of a merchant. Upon their father’s death, <br>
            Cassim marries a wealthy woman and becomes well-to-do running his father’s business. <br>
            Ali Baba is a humble woodcutter. One day, he stumbles upon forty thieves visiting <br>
            their treasure in a cave. The entrance is blocked by a large boulder that can only <br>|
            be opened and closed with the words “open sesame” and “close sesame”.
        </p>
        <p>
           
            When the thieves are gone, Ali Baba enters the cave and steals a single bag of gold. <br>
            Cassim’s wife discovers the gold and forces Ali Baba to reveal where he found it. <br>
            He shows Cassim the cave and the magic phrases, and Cassim enters with a mule to steal <br>
            as much treasure as possible. However, he forgets the phrase upon leaving and becomes <br>
            trapped in the cave, where the thieves find him and kill him. Ali Baba returns when the <br>
            thieves are gone and retrieves his brother’s body and the thieves learn that someone <br>
            else must know of their cave. Three thieves each take turns attempting to find Ali Baba’s <br>
            home but are foiled by the enslaved girl, Morgiana. When she kills the leader of the thieves, <br>
            Ali Baba is so grateful he awards her freedom and marries her to his son.
