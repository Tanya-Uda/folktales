        <h2><a href="beauty.html">Vasilisa the Beautiful</a></h2>
        <p>           
            Vasilisa the Beautiful is a Russian folktale and one of many stories of Baba Yaga, <br>
            who first appeared in writing in 1755. The story was originally passed down orally <br>
            but was later published by Alexander Nikolayevich Afanasyev in the mid-1800s. <br>
            As with many folktales, it was told to children. Primarily the story taught the <br>
            value of hard work and that beauty, even outer beauty, comes from within. When <br>
            Vasilisa was eight years old, her mother died. While on her deathbed, she gave <br>
            Vasilisa a Motanka doll and directed her not to tell anyone she had it. Whenever <br>
            Vasilisa gave the doll something to eat and drink, it would help her with whatever <br>
            she wanted. Soon, her father remarried a woman with two daughters of her own who were <br>
            cruel to the beautiful Vasilisa whenever her father was away.

            The family moved into the woods where Baba Yaga was rumored to live. The stepmother <br>
            plotted to send the girl out into the woods so that Baba Yaga would eat her. None of <br>
            her schemes worked, however, and Vasilisa grew more beautiful every day, much to the <br>
            stepmother’s jealousy. Eventually the girl was tasked with retrieving a flame from <br>
            Baba Yaga’s hut to light their house. In exchange for the flame, Baba Yaga ordered <br>
            the girl to complete several impossible tasks in a single day. With the help of the <br>
            doll, however, she completed the tasks and took a skull with burning coals home to <br>
            her step-family, where the coals burned them alive. Vasilisa, however, went on to become <br>
            a skilled cloth maker and eventually married the Tsar. Today, tales of Baba Yaga are <br>
            popular across Eastern Europe and around the world.
