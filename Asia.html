        <h2><a href="zodiac.html">The Zodiac Story</a></h2>
        <p>
            The tale of the Chinese zodiac can be traced back to the Han Dynasty, <br>
            although the specific author is unknown. Different versions of the story <br>
            exist all across Asia, including Cambodia, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, <br>
            and Vietnam. Each animal, the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse,<br>
            goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig, represents a single year in a 12-year cycle.<br> 
            The story is largely about the different personalities you can find in a person<br> 
            and about the ones you should admire, and the ones you should not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Chinese zodiac is a simple story. The Jade Emperor, the first God, declares <br>
            a race to determine which animals will represent each year. The rat won the race <br>
            by taking advantage of its disadvantages, but also by stepping on others to get ahead.<br>
            The Ox was hardworking but came in second place. The pig, lazy after eating and <br>
            sleeping, finished the race last. The message of the tale is universal. Today, <br>
            <a href="zodiac.html">The Zodiac Story</a> is still a popular folktale across the globe. b
